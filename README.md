Multiplicative Persistance

I'm using this mathematical problem as a way to learn about python.
Starting from scratch so it might not be the most fancy code you'll ever see
but im proud if it works ^^.

If you have suggestions on how to make my algorythims more efficient feel free to
send me a PN even if you just have a website or smth that could help ^^.
